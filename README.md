# Telecom_Customer_Churn_Analysis:


## Project Description
This project is an end-to-end churn analysis built using Python, SQL, and Tableau to explore customer behavior and identify churn drivers in a telecom dataset (Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn).

Unlike a typical churn project, this analysis was intentionally designed to simulate a real business environment. I asked AI to generate realistic stakeholder questions, similar to what a retention manager or product owner would ask. These questions guided the entire workflow—from EDA to SQL segmentation to dashboard design.

The result is a stakeholder-driven churn insights dashboard, highlighting churn risk, service adoption patterns, payment friction, high-value customer loss, and tenure-based churn behavior.


## Dataset

Source: Kaggle - Teleco Customer Churn

Get the dataset from: [raw_data](Data_raw.csv)

Key field used: ``customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, tenure, Contract, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, InternetService, Churn``

Notes:
- Handled missing values and type conversions .
- Created derived columns: `tenure_group`, `monthly_revenue_lost`


## Tools And Libraries
- Dashboard: Tableau 
- Data cleaning & analysis: Python (pandas), SQL(MySQL)
- Visuals & charts: Matplotlib,Seaborn and Tableau visuals
- Notebook: Jupyter Notebook 
- Version control & hosting: GitHub
