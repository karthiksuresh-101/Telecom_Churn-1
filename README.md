# Telecom_Customer_Churn_Analysis:
## Project Description
This project is an end-to-end churn analysis built using Python, SQL, and Tableau to explore customer behavior and identify churn drivers in a telecom dataset (Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn).

Unlike a typical churn project, this analysis was intentionally designed to simulate a real business environment. I asked AI to generate realistic stakeholder questions, similar to what a retention manager or product owner would ask. These questions guided the entire workflow—from EDA to SQL segmentation to dashboard design.

The result is a stakeholder-driven churn insights dashboard, highlighting churn risk, service adoption patterns, payment friction, high-value customer loss, and tenure-based churn behavior.


## Program parameters
```
input_file = str            # Path to raw Telco Customer Churn dataset (CSV)
output_file = str           # Path for cleaned dataset export
numeric_fields = []         # Numeric columns to convert (e.g., TotalCharges)
service_columns = []        # Service subscription fields used for pivot/EDA
tenure_bins = []            # Tenure grouping thresholds for lifecycle analysis
tenure_labels = []          # Labels for grouped tenure ranges
```

## How to Explore the Analysis

## This project is fully contained inside one notebook:

** telecom_churn_analysis.ipynb **

This notebook includes the complete workflow:

- Data loading
- Preprocessing (missing values, data types, feature creation)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- VisualizationsChurn segment analysis
- Exporting cleaned data to connect with the dashboard
